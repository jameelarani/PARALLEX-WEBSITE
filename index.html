               <p> Tawang was historically part of Tibet. The 1914 Simla Accord defined the McMahon Line as the new boundary between British India and Tibet. By this treaty, Tibet relinquished several hundred square miles of its territory, including Tawang, to the British, but it was not recognised by China.[6] When Tibet was not governed by mainland China, Tawang was easily accessible to Tibetans. </p>

               <p> Chand Baori is said to be named after a local ruler of Nikumbh dynasty called Raja Chanda.[5][6] However, no epigraphic evidence has been found regarding the construction of the Chand Baori or the adjoining Harshat Mata Temple. Based on similarities in style and carvings with the terraced temples of Paranagar and Mandore, the Baori can be dated to the 8th-9th century.[7] It was likely constructed before the temple.[8] According to Morna Livingston in Steps to Water: The Ancient Stepwells of India, Chand Baori is one of the few stepwells that has "two classical periods of water building in a single setting" </p>
